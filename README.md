# Prot16 themes for code highlight with Jekyll and Rouge

Every basic website built with Jekyll will use the Rouge gem to highlight code syntax. You can customise the look and feel by adding any of these themes to `_sass/_syntax.scss`.

Also check you `_config.yml` for the following options:

```
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  syntax_highlighting: rouge
highlighter: rouge
```
